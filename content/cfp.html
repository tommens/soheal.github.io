<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
<p>
  <b>SoHeal</b> aims to enable and promote collaboration between academia and industry, unifying the views on software health of researchers and practitioners. The workshop's goals are to: (1) raise awareness of practitioners' problems with software health; (2) familiarize practitioners with the progress made by academia; and (3) connect the two communities to further advance the body of knowledge and state of the practice on software health.
</p>

  We invite two types of contributions: <b>full position papers</b> of 6 to 8 pages (including figures, tables and references), or <b>extended abstracts</b> of 1 to 2 pages reporting on practitioner's or industrial experience.
